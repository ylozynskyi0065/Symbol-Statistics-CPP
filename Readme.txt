This project was ment to proove how hard is to break something that is almost well defined by simple rules.
In this explicit case the input is a file that has close to 50% 1 and 50% 0s. The challange is to find a short algorithm that can destroy the rule of the 50% in the file and bring it to an unbalanced state of ex 25% / 72%.
There is a logical reason why you can't do it, but the whole idea of this project is to let you find out why.

spoiler : you could apply this method recursively until you end up with a 2 bit long file that could generate any file :)
